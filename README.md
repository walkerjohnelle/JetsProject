# JetsProject

# Project Overview:

This project is a fleet management application for jets with diverse capabilities. Users can interact with the program through a menu to perform various actions, including listing jets, controlling flight, viewing information about specific jets, and managing the fleet.

# Technologies Used:

Java 
Object-oriented programming principles
Inheritance and polymorphism
Interfaces for specialized behavior

# Lessons Learned:

I had fun with this one, but being in the Air Force and having close experience ith flying operations, I definitely overcomplicated things early on but all in all, I did lean a lot. Especially in designing flexible and extensible class hierarchies for different jet types. Utilizing interfaces effectively for specialized functionalities.
Implementing user-friendly menus and interactive features. Handling data manipulation and calculations within the program.
